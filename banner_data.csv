CONTRAINDICATIONS  Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Infections  Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.  Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.  Hypersensitivity  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each 50.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease  During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn‘s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz 80 mg Q2W group (Crohn‘s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis and in the Taltz Q4W group in ankylosing spondylitis trials (Crohn’s disease 1.0% [2 patients], ulcerative colitis 0.5% [1 patient]) than in the placebo group (Crohn’s disease 0.5% [1 patient], ulcerative colitis 0%). In the ankylosing spondylitis trials, serious events occurred in 1 patient in the Taltz group and 1 patient in the placebo group.  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all ageappropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most common adverse reactions (21%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis were consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis.

In the ankylosing spondylitis trials, serious events occurred in 1 patient in the Taltz group and 1 patient in the placebo group.  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most common adverse reactions (21%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis were consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis.

HCP - RHEUM Animated Banner MOA_p24-96.png,320,3299,"INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  Taltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz is also indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  CONTRAINDICATIONS  Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Infections  Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar' Increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves  Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.  Hypersensitivity  Serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and urticaria (each 50.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy  Inflammatory Bowel Disease  During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (Crohn‘s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age- appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most common adverse reactions (21%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis.

IX-DERM-HCP Commercial Access EHR Banner 2022_p4-16.png,473,4578,"INDICATIONS  Taltz is indicated for patients aged 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz is also indicated for adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), for adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and for adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inﬂammation.  CONTRAINDICATIONS  Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Infections  Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non- radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.  Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection priorto initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB priorto administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.  Hypersensitivity  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each <0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.  Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease  Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inﬂammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inﬂammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most common adverse reactions (21%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety proﬁles observed in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis were consistent with the safety proﬁle in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of inﬂuenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis and conjunctivitis, inﬂuenza, and urticaria in pediatric psoriasis.

IX-HCP - DERM Animated Banner PASI100_2020_p16-64.png,445,4673,"INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  Taltz is indicated for adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), for adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and for adults with active non- radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation. Taltz is also indicated for patients aged 6 years or older with moderate- to-severe plaque psoriasis (Ps0) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  CONTRAINDICATIONS  Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Infections  Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.  Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.  Hypersensitivity  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each 50.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post- marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease  Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines.

IX-HCP-DERM Patient Banner - 2022_p7-55.png,420,2419,"Indications  Taltz is indicated for patients aged 6 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Ps0) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz is also indicated for adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), for adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and for adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inﬂammation.  CONTRAINDICATIONS  Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Infections  Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). Asimilar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advrce if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. lfa serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.  Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.  Hypersensitivity  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each 50.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post- marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease  Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inflammatow bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inﬂammatow bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.  Immunizations  Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most common adverse reactions (21%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non—radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis were consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of inﬂuenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis and conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria in pediatric psoriasis.
